  The second of the two VIIRS DNB-based datasets is a daily moonlight- and atmosphere-corrected Nighttime Lights (NTL) product called
  VIIRS/NPP Gap-Filled Lunar BRDF-Adjusted Nighttime Lights Daily L3 Global 500m Linear Lat Lon Grid.
  Known by its short-name, VNP46A2, this product contains seven Science Data Sets (SDS) that include DNB BRDF-Corrected NTL,
  Gap-Filled DNB BRDF-Corrected NTL, DNB Lunar Irradiance, Latest High-Quality Retrieval, Mandatory Quality Flag, Cloud Mask Quality Flag, and Snow Flag.
  VNP46A2 products are provided in standard Hierarchical Data Format-Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS5) format.
  This collection starts from January 19, 2012 and forward.

  This ZARR version of the dataset currently only includes the grid file at h11v07, around the Caribbean Sea.

# The recipes section tells Pangeo Cloud where to find the recipes within your PR.
# Many recipe PRs will have just 1 recipe, in which case this section will look similar to the example below.
# If your PR contains multiple recipes, you may add additional elements to the list below.

    # The `object` below tells Pangeo Cloud specifically where your recipe instance(s) are located and uses the format <filename>:<object_name>
    # <filename> is name of .py file where the Python recipe object is defined.
    # For example, if <filename> is given as "recipe", Pangeo Cloud will expect a file named `recipe.py` to exist in your PR.
    # <object_name> is the name of the recipe object (i.e. Python class instance) _within_ the specified file.
    # For example, if you have defined `recipe = XarrayZarrRecipe(...)` within a file named `recipe.py`, then your  `object` below would be `"recipe:recipe"`
