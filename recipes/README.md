# Welcome to `staged-recipes`!

## Template
Looking to submit a recipe? Check out [the Pangeo Forge sandbox](https://github.com/pangeo-forge/sandbox). It has a template for the recipe module (ex. `recipe.py`) and `meta.yml`, which will be needed for the pull request.
* example recipe files can be found [here](https://github.com/pangeo-forge/sandbox/tree/main/recipe). 
* an interactive coding environment with the examples is available [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pangeo-forge/sandbox/binder).

## Organization
When you add your recipe module and `meta.yml` in this folder, please do so in a new folder.

For example:
```
recipes/
 │
 └──your_dataset_name/
     ├──recipe.py
     └──meta.yml
```
