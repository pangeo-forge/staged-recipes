# The recipes section tells Pangeo Cloud where to find the recipes within your PR.
# Many recipe PRs will have just 1 recipe, in which case this section will look similar to the example below.
# If your PR contains multiple recipes, you may add additional elements to the list below.
recipes:
  # User chosen name for recipe. Likely similiar to dataset name, ~25 characters in length

    # The `object` below tells Pangeo Cloud specifically where your recipe instance(s) are located and uses the format <filename>:<object_name>
    # <filename> is name of .py file where the Python recipe object is defined.
    # For example, if <filename> is given as "recipe", Pangeo Cloud will expect a file named `recipe.py` to exist in your PR.
    # <object_name> is the name of the recipe object (i.e. Python class instance) _within_ the specified file.
    # For example, if you have defined `recipe = XarrayZarrRecipe(...)` within a file named `recipe.py`, then your  `object` below would be `"recipe:recipe"`
