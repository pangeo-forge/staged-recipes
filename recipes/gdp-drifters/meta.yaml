description: >
  This dataset includes hourly sea surface temperature and current data collected by satellite-tracked
  surface drifting buoys ("drifters") of the NOAA Global Drifter Program. The Drifter Data Assembly Center (DAC)
  at NOAAâ€™s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) has applied quality control procedures
  and processing to edit these observational data and obtain estimates at regular hourly intervals.
  The data include positions (latitude and longitude), sea surface temperatures (total, diurnal, and non-diurnal components)
  and velocities (eastward, northward) with accompanying uncertainty estimates. Metadata include identification numbers,
  experiment number, start location and time, end location and time, drogue loss date, death code, manufacturer, and drifter type.
